# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The front end code KSolver.cpp is a direct edit of @ShootMe's KlondikeSolver.cpp.
It implements a largely compatible interface to facilitate comparison or migration.

The remaining code in this repository, aside from robin_hood.h, is original but its general outline 
and its best ideas are all based on @ShootMe's work.

robin_hood.h, the high-performance hash map that makes this code fast, is the work of
Martin Ankerl \(@martinus\).
