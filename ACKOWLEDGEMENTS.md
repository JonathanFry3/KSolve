# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The front end code KSolve.cpp is a direct edit of @ShootMe's KlondikeSolver.cpp.
It implements a largely compatible interface to facilitate comparison or migration.
KSolve2Solvitaire.cpp is an edit of KSolve.cpp, so indirectly of KlondikeSolver.cpp.

parallel_hashset, an unordered_set-like structure especially well adapted to 
multi-threaded operation,
is the work of Gregory Popovitch \(@greg7mdp on github\).

The remaining code in this repository is original 
to Jonathan Fry but its general outline 
and its best ideas are all based on @ShootMe's work.  I lifted those ideas before 
I became aware of the basis of some of them, the A* algorithm.
