# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The front end code KSolver.cpp is a direct edit of @ShootMe's KlondikeSolver.cpp.
It implements a largely compatible interface to facilitate comparison or migration.

The remaining code in this repository, aside from parallel_hashmap, is original 
but its general outline 
and its best ideas are all based on @ShootMe's work.  I lifted those ideas before 
I became aware of their basis, the A* algorithm.

parallel_hashmap, an unordered_map-like structure especially well adapted to 
multi-threaded operation,
is the work of Gregory Popovitch \(@greg7mdp on github\).
