# What is This
I play Klondike on my iPhone using MobilityWare's app. It features two 
leader boards showing the 25 players with the fewest moves for each 
day's daily challenge game - one for draw one, and one for draw 3.
I play only draw 1 games, as I take too long to win draw 3 games, and I can't
record the deal without seeing where all the cards are, which usually requires
winning the game.

The *KSolve* program can usually do as well as any player, but on some
days, it does better than any other player, and on some days, it does
not do as well.  Those days when it does not match the best score
posted concern me.  They suggest a flaw, although there are other
possibilities. In this directory, I am
collecting those deals so that when I have a possible fix, I can
test it against them.

I have not been able to 
obtain any of the move sequences shorter than *KSolve* gives.  Without
that data, I have little idea where to look for the problem.

The problem deals are in the files with a hat ("^") in their names; the files
whose names end with "-top" are games where *KSolve* beat everyone. I
collect those out of vanity.
